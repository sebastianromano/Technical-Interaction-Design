Thinking in Columns
- e.g. read from left to right
- separates
| read | write |
| ---- | ----- |

Avoid ambiguous spacing
- gestalt?
	- proximity

Colors
- Primary colors

HEX vs HSL
- can use HEX in CSS
	- HEX is a code (maybe 6 different characters)
- HSL is more intuitive
	- you can increment the colors
		- [ ] find example
- Choose your primary color
	- that color should be prevalent throughout design
	- find the extremes
		- maximum and minimum shades
			- darkest usually text
				- switch it around if "dark mode"?
	- ensure enough contrast to see content (text etc.)
	- 
Defining the color palettes?

==Don't do usability test in Figma==

- Kaggle (on react maybe)
- Scrimba on react
	- anything that goes through *class components* you do not need to go through that - it's usually outdated
