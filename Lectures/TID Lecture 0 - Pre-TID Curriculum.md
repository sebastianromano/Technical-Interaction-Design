# Lecture 0 - Pre-TID Curriculum

## Todo

Before you can begin your web development adventure, you should install some software to make your life easier. Code is really just text, and you can write a website in Notepad, but perhaps you shouldn't. If the name ‘VS code’ is unfamiliar to you, please take time to install it and familiarize yourself a bit with how this program allows you to quickly and easily write code.

After installing VS code you will find below a few extensions for you to install.

Required Software:

**Download and install the "Stable Build" VS Code IDE for your OS:**

- [x] [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

_You can use any IDE or text editor you like, but the golden standard these days is VS code, and the TID course will assume you use this. If you do not, you are on your own IDE-wise._

**Install the extension Prettier in Visual Studio Code:**                    

- [x] [Prettier - Code formatter - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

_Standardizing code format is not just for fun. You will do yourselves and us a favour by getting used to this tool when working in a team. Find it by clicking the link, or in VS code under extensions (search for “Prettier - Code formatter”)._

Useful tools:

**Live server**            

- [x] [Live Server - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

_This tool lets you create a constantly updating instance of a website during development. It will not be used during the course, as we will be using a framework that takes care of this. For practice of web technologies until then, this is a very useful tool._

**Bracket colorisation**

After installing VS Code, find the settings menu in the far lower left side corner. Select Settings. On the search bar in the top of the settings menu, search for: Bracket Pair Colorization

Click the checkbox and rejoice. Which opening and closing brackets are matching is now visualised.

## Online courses

Scrimba is a great platform where you can sort of "dualcode" with the instructor. The platform offers an in-browser IDE where you can pause the video and change the instructor’s code at any point in order to understand through experimentation. We suggest that you do the challenges as much as possible. Learning is repeating. It is recommended to utilize the microlearning app described below to bolster what you learn during these lessons. Though Scrimba also have paid content, all courses linked below are free.

## Microlearning

Sololearn is a microlearning app you can install on your phone. You can also use the web app on your computer, but if you dedicate time to learning the material it is recommended to utilize an online course instead. What microlearning does well is teaching one thing at a time in small doses. Microlearning utilizes those moments when you are on the train or using the restroom where you would otherwise check your messages or play a mobile game. Microlearning is learning through small but rapid repetition and does not yield usable skills on its own unless you _keep doing it_ over a longer period. Should be combined with practice either of your own volition or in concert with for instance an online course.
